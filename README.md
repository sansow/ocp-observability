Red Hat OpenShift Observability aims at turning your data into answers. Not only are we working toward facilitating metrics, traces, and logs collection/storage, but also to aggregate them, normalize them, transport them in a flexible way - as well as to assess the health of your cluster(s) with intuitive and efficient user interfaces.
